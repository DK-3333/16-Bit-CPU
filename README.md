# 16-Bit-CPU

1. 16 - Bit CPU design using Logisim.
2. It consists of 16-bit ALU, Control Unit of ALU, Control Unit, 16-bit register.
3. Instruments required for the design of basic cpu:  
    •	A memory unit with 4096 words of 16 bits each.  
    •	Nine registers: AR, PC, DR, IR, AC, TR, OUTR, INPR and SC.  
    •	Seven flip-flops: I, S, E, R, IEN, FGI and FGO.  
    •	2 decoders: a 3X8 operation decoder and a 4 X 16 timing decoder.  
    •	A 16-bit common bus.  
    •	Control Logic Gates  
    •	Adder & logic circuit connected to the input of AC.
